# DEV LOG

So much of our conflicts are triggered by our unconscious human projection onto others. All the tapestry of shadows we can't, won't or don't know how to access or engage with, and that get triggered internally, externally & interpersonally. 

This blog is exploring projection in 3 forms. 

This written exploration, where i'm going to look at some part of my own pysche, & testing out some of the *ideas, claims & insights from the more foundationa*l arts of buddhist philosophy, western psychology & applying with curious intention to see how they actively change my own perceptual framework from different povs. 

The artistic expression, where im using AV composition with Narrative structure to attempt to express a **short narrative arc over 3 different styles of music,** Downtempo/Orchestral, Dope/Beats, & Dynamic/Electronics. 

And a podcast which will mix a bit of both, with some other music & visual. 

My aim is to explore different aspects of our human condition, through the lense of Projection, and really test out two practices which in my 47 years so far seem to hold the most potential for pragmatic personal Integration, Buddhist Meditation & [[Atlas/Maps/Internal Family Systems\|Internal Family Systems]], but that will remain to be seen. 

This is far and away from any notion of self help, and there will be no advice or blanket motivational messages. I believe that its relatively pointless knowing something on a conceptual level. Knowing that everything is impermanent for example doesn't change much aside from maybe a few choices. But actively looking through the lense of impermanence, and seeing how that changes my perception of the world and it's perception of me, gives me something of more substance to build or explore upon. [[Atlas/Dots/People/@Rob Burbea\|@Rob Burbea]] is to thank for that way of looking, and his book which i've recently started is going to feature in some of the explorations no doubt. 

I[[ also want with the AV side\| also want with the AV side]], to create compositions that i can refer to that either keep me on track, or help with this exploration. I've had this driving notion, some may say obsession, for well over a decade, and only recently find myself able to imagine sketches, scenes & storyboards that aren't really obvious or arbitrary. It has resulted in creating what seem like effective av composition & personal integration frameworks that i've always hoped might be useful to other people. Especially the fellow neurodiverse creatives who may have similar aspirations, and they are something i can try out with this blog & creative output, but again we'll see. 

I've got an online platform setup as i think both sides are well suited to collaboration or some kind of community connection, but how feasible that will be to manage is another question, but the AV side i plan to document the useful approaches i learn on Narrative AV & the more Integration side with writing & AV compositions will be on this core Deprojection project. 

[[Atlas/Sources/Article & Video/Projection\|Projection]] itself is [ChatGPT - Stop Projecting, Increase Self-Awareness](https://chatgpt.com/share/69010e7b-67dc-8005-b092-c64aa7ebac30)....

Some of my experience relating [[Atlas/Dots/CARDS/Personal Identity\|Personal Identity]] & [[Efforts/! THE PRACTICE/03. INTEGRATION/3.4. CURATING/Storyboards/Deprojection 01. Identity & Isolation\|Deprojection 01. Identity & Isolation]] with [[Atlas/Dots/CARDS/projection\|projection]] is in [[2025-10-15 1\|2025-10-15 1]]

And with the central exploration of the notion of the 12 nyamas, wheel of life, craving & clinging, how that manifests in all the subtle ways. And this idea of not needing anything or anyone. ..that last one goes against what i think of..i'm feeling like this because i havent seen people - thats not healthy. Which is true, we are social creatures, but can i, and is it notably beneficial if i, can learn not be connected without human interaction. And the idea of parts, & [[Atlas/Maps/Internal Family Systems\|Internal Family Systems]] framing, instead of im lonely because there's something missing from me, that there's a part of me that's lonely, and opening a dialogue with that. Where would that go. Would it lead anywhere. Thats a compelling question. 

And [[Atlas/Dots/People/@Rob Burbea\|@Rob Burbea]] ideas of looking at fabrication, proliferation, papancha, insight ways of looking and how the practice of seeing & meditating, changes perceptual frameworks from inside & out. Some way to record & share this is a strong conceptual framework for the art to live within. People need to know why they would be interested to take time to listen.
