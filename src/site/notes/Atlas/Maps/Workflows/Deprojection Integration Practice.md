*We are run by our stories, as is our world, but we can change them*

- Meditation Practice (Sitting / Guided)
	- Reflection Practice (Writing / Prompts)
	- Thoughts throughout day (Journaling / Capture)
	- Reading / Listening
	- Processing 
	- Speaking with others on the path
		- What paths 
			- Buddhism
			- Qaballa
		- What people
			- Seth Godin
			- Mooji
			- Fill this in
	- Creating Zettelkasten in themes & expanding on ideas. 
		- Create Atomic notes, connecting knowledge & creating Maps of Content

 i think [[Atlas/Dots/CARDS/The Wheel of Life\|The Wheel of Life]] is a core one that i can integrate for pragmatic practice. Referring to a lot of the later chapters will be useful too. 
## Process

- journal on my experiences that relate to the various sub themes & ideas connected with the core theme.
- note what i learn from others & connect them to my reflection
- monitor an experiment to test my assertions from some pragmatic action or practice in the real world
- speak to others in the community about the themes, assertions, insights & shared experience.
- write a blog, that is distrubuted on the site, on substack, & extruded into social media posts & the [[Atlas/Sources/Tools/Heartbeat\|Heartbeat]] community posts 
# DEV LOG

- [[Calendar/Days/2025/2025-05-12\|2025-05-12]] Integrate AI into the process
	[[Atlas/Maps/Workflows/A Pragmatic Guide to Shadow Work & Discerning Projection\|A Pragmatic Guide to Shadow Work & Discerning Projection]] needs adding
	Using AI for the different process also needs adding - maybe similar to the [[Atlas/Maps/Workflows/Example of Shadow Projection Work with a family member excluding family members.\|Example of Shadow Projection Work with a family member excluding family members.]]
