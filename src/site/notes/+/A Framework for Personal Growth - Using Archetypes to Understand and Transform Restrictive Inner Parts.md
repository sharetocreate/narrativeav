##### This workflow enables me to : 
- Transform Restrictive Inner Parts Using Archetypes & IFS to embody them

# HOW

### A Guide to Externalising Inner Parts

*This workflow is designed to be undertaken by an individual, with the optional support of an expert for deeper exploration.*

##### Phase 1: Identifying and Understanding the "Part"
Acknowledge and Name the "Part": Begin by identifying a specific, recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that you find restrictive. Examples include "the one who craves intoxication," "the procrastinator," "the inner critic," or "the people-pleaser." Give this part a simple, descriptive name. This initial step, inspired by IFS, helps to separate the "part" from your core self.

Get to Know the Part's Intention: Before assigning an archetype, sit with this "part" with curiosity and compassion. Ask it questions, either through journaling or quiet contemplation:

What are you trying to achieve for me? (Even seemingly destructive parts often have a protective intention, e.g., the "intoxication part" might be seeking escape from pain or a sense of connection).

What are you afraid would happen if you didn't do this job?

What feelings or beliefs are you carrying?

##### Phase 2: Finding the Archetypal Character
This phase involves using the Thoth Tarot (or another system) to find a character that resonates with the "part" you've identified.

###### Option A: Intuitive Selection

**Visual Exploration:** Look through the images of the 78 Thoth Tarot cards without reading the descriptions. Which image intuitively "feels" like the "part" you are exploring? Trust your gut reaction.

**Read the Description:** Once you have selected a card, read its detailed description (e.g., on tarotx.net). Pay close attention to both the upright and reversed (or light and shadow) meanings. Does the description resonate with the feelings, behaviors, and intentions of your "part"?

###### Option B: Keyword Search

**Identify Keywords**: Based on your understanding of the "part," brainstorm some keywords. For the "intoxication part," keywords might include: "escape," "pleasure-seeking," "addiction," "loss of control," "illusion," or "spiritual thirst."

**Search the Descriptions**: Use a site search or simply browse the card meanings for your keywords. Several cards might resonate, offering different facets of the "part." For example, for intoxication, you might be drawn to The Moon (illusion, subconscious desires), The Devil (bondage, materialism), or the Ace of Cups reversed (emotional overflow, unhealthy attachments).

##### Phase 3: Personalizing the Archetype
This is a crucial step in making the archetype a potent tool for personal change.

**Adopt or Adapt the Name**: You can use the card's name directly (e.g., "My inner Devil"). However, to make it more personal and specific to your experience, you might create a new name that captures the essence of the archetype's quality you want to focus on. For instance, instead of "The Devil," you might name the part "The Shadow-Craver" or, for its aspirational side, "The Liberator."

**Create a Personal Image**: The Thoth Tarot images are powerful, but you can create an even more effective image for yourself. This image should be easily recalled in moments of craving or when the "part" is activated.

**Collage**: Create a digital or physical collage with images that represent both the shadow and light aspects of the archetype for you.

**Drawing or Painting**: Even a simple sketch can be incredibly powerful.

**Mental Image**: Develop a clear mental picture that you can bring to mind. This image should encapsulate both the warning (the shadow) and the aspiration (the light).

##### Phase 4: Integration and Transformation

**Dialogue with the Archetype**: Engage in a written or imagined dialogue with your newly characterized "part." Acknowledge its presence and its perceived needs.

**Acknowledge the Shadow**: "I see you, Shadow-Craver. I understand you want to escape the pressure and find a moment of peace."

**Introduce the Aspiration**: "I also see the potential for you to be 'The Liberator,' to find true freedom and joy without the chains of intoxication."

**Use the Image as a "Pattern Interrupt"**: When you feel the pull of the restrictive behavior (e.g., the dopamine craving), bring your personalized image to mind. Let it remind you of:

**The Shadow's Consequences**: The negative outcomes of falling into the old pattern.

**The Light's Promise**: The aspirational qualities you are striving for.

**Embody the Aspirational Qualities**: Actively cultivate the positive aspects of the archetype. If your archetype is the "Two of Disks" (Change), which can represent stagnation or dynamic balance, you can consciously choose small actions that embody balanced change rather than feeling stuck.

#### Layers of Complexity and Alternative Systems

This basic workflow can be deepened and adapted based on individual needs and preferences.
###### Higher Level of Complexity:

**Connecting Multiple Cards**: Explore the relationships between different archetypes. For example, your "procrastinator part" (perhaps represented by the Four of Swords - Truce) might be influenced by an "inner critic" (Five of Swords - Defeat). Understanding this interplay can reveal deeper patterns.

**Astrological and Qabalistic Correspondences**: The Thoth Tarot is rich with astrological and Qabalistic symbolism. For those interested, exploring these layers can provide profound insights into the archetypes' meanings.

**Working with an Expert**: A therapist or a knowledgeable tarot reader can guide you through this process, helping you to see blind spots and offering deeper interpretations.

###### Alternative Archetypal Systems:

**For a Simpler Framework**: The 12 Common Archetypes: Based on the work of Carl Jung and popularized by Carol S. Pearson, these 12 archetypes (e.g., The Innocent, The Orphan, The Hero, The Caregiver) offer a more straightforward starting point.

- *Best for*: Beginners who may find the 78 cards of the tarot overwhelming.

**For a Psychologically-Focused Approach**: The Enneagram: This system describes nine fundamental personality types, each with its own set of motivations, fears, and paths for growth.

- *Best for*: Individuals who resonate with a more psychological and personality-based framework.

**For a Focus on Life Stages and Challenges**: The Systems Archetypes: These are recurring patterns of behavior in systems (including personal ones) such as "Fixes that Fail" or "Shifting the Burden."

- *Best for*: Understanding the dynamic nature of personal challenges and how solutions can sometimes perpetuate the problem.


# INFO

For individuals seeking to understand and transform restrictive inner aspects of themselves, such as addictive tendencies or procrastination, a structured approach using archetypal systems like the [[Thoth Tarot\|Thoth Tarot]] can provide a powerful and accessible framework. This guide outlines a workflow designed for a layperson to identify these internal "parts," give them a rich, symbolic character, and create personalised tools for self-awareness and change. This process draws inspiration from the [[Atlas/Maps/Internal Family Systems\|Internal Family Systems]] (IFS) model, which views the psyche as comprised of various "parts" with their own beliefs and motivations.*

This framework offers a creative and insightful way to engage with what [[Atlas/Dots/People/@Carl Jung\|@Carl Jung]] termed "[[the shadow self\|the shadow self]]" – the unconscious aspects of our personality that we often repress or ignore. By giving these parts a voice and a face through archetypes, we can move from a place of internal conflict to one of compassion, understanding, and ultimately, integration.

##### The Power of Archetypes for Inner Work

[[Atlas/Maps/Archetypes\|Archetypes]] are universal, primordial symbols and images that reside in the collective unconscious. They represent fundamental human motivations and experiences. The Thoth Tarot, with its intricate esoteric symbolism, provides a particularly rich and nuanced set of 78 archetypes. Each card, as detailed on resources like tarotx.net, encapsulates both the "light" (aspirational) and "shadow" (challenging) aspects of an archetype, offering a clear map for personal growth. This duality is crucial, as it presents a pathway for transformation – a "downward spiral" to be aware of and an "upward spiral" to aspire to.

While the [[Atlas/Maps/Workflows/Thoth Tarot Workflow\|Thoth Tarot Workflow]] is an excellent resource, this workflow can be adapted to other archetypal systems, offering varying levels of complexity.

##### Conclusion: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Compassion

By externalising and embodying our restrictive inner "parts" through the rich language of archetypes, we can transform our relationship with them. 

This process is not about eliminating these parts but about understanding their underlying needs and integrating them into a more whole and empowered self. 

The Thoth Tarot, with its profound symbolism and dualistic nature, offers an exceptional toolkit for this journey. 

However, the most effective system is ultimately the one that resonates most deeply with the individual, providing a clear mirror for self-reflection and a tangible path toward positive change. 

This creative and compassionate approach can empower anyone to become the conscious author of their own inner world.
